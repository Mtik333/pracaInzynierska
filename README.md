First attempts on Ant Colony Optimization solving the problem of finding possibly the best reduct in dataset.

0.0.1 - 29.06.2017__
First attempts on trying to create the interface and kind of logic:
- dataset in .csv can be loaded and showed in textarea

0.0.2 - 29.06.2017__
Cleaning the controller a bit and adding the Logic class for most of the computations and handling loading the file

0.0.3 - 01.07.2017__
First attempts on graph drawing
- next commits going to focus on ant colony rather than GUI

0.1.0 - 09.07.2017__
A kinda huge difference, because there's a working Ant object
- ants find the solution using discrebility matrix
- graphics are abandoned right now, it's gonna be a web application due to drawing graphs issues

0.1.1 - 09.07.2017__
Ant algorithm probably works, although experiments for bigger datasets have to be performed
- it's difficult now to set proper constans for pheromones update, some edges got ultrapheromoned
